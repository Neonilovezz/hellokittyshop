            <p class="text1"> While the majority of her official character profiles call her "Hello Kitty" or just
                "Kitty", her real name is Kitty White, and she was born in the suburbs of London, England on November
                1st. Her height is described as five apples and her weight as three apples. She is portrayed as a cute,
                bright, sweet, kind-hearted and tomboyish girl who can do anything she sets her mind to. She has many
                friends such as My Melody and she is very close to her slightly younger identical twin sister Mimmy.
                Kitty is good at baking although she claims that she is an awful chef in the Hello Kitty and Friends
                episode "The Wonderful Sisters".

            <p class="text2">My Melody's younger brother Rhythm can be a little bit of a rascal, but she loves him
                dearly. Her mama enjoys doing crafts and loves baking cookies with her. Her gentle, strong papa must be
                where she gets her kind disposition. Her treasured hood was made just for her by her very knowledgeable
                grandma, while her grandpa loves adventures! She is best friends with Flat, a blue mouse who is a bit
                shy, and she is typically very friendly towards her rival Kuromi. My Melody's best friend is My Sweet
                Piano, a pink sheep who is soft, kind and girly.</p>

        <div class="box2">
            <p class="text3"> Kuromi is a character from the My Melody universe. She is My Melody's rival and
                doppelg√§nger, and manifests as a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a
                pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression on her forehead changes
                to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is on Halloween. Kuromi's name translates
                from Japanese to English as "black beauty". Her mother and father wears a very similar outfit as
                herself.</p>
